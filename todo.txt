# Build
- add CMake target_compile_features

# Functionality
## Widgets
### LineEdit

- 'x' button to delete contents (unicode 'MULTIPLICATION SIGN' U+00D7)
- handle CTRL and ALT properly (suppress input)
  - ok for normal keys
  - but e.g. alt + arrrowUp gives 'kUP3' and ctrl + arrowUp gives 'kUP5', and shift + arrowLeft 
    gives KEY_SLEFT
  --> possibly suppress all keys with length of keyname() > 1
- nice-to-have: autocomplete
  - pop-down over other widgets, no realignment
  - concept of layers? (also e.g. for menus, dialogs)
- nice-to-have: text mask and/or regexp mask
- proper inverse input area
- copy/paste behavior?
- yield focus to 'next' widget when pressing enter (form-like behavior)

### ListBox

- autocomplete

### ProgressBar

### StatusBar

### MenuBar

### DatePicker

### TimePicker

### DataTable

- cells should be widgets (or, initially, strings)
- sortable by column
- filterable

### Tree (nice-to-have)

### Tab

### Card/Stack

- a widget that can have multiple children, with only one child
  visible at a time

### Dialog

- overlay
- always modal
- probably not movable

### TextArea

- multi-line input
- similar to LineEdit (LineEdit could actually be a TextArea of height 1)
- also for read-only output, e.g. log
- scrollable
- optionally discard top lines when scrolling? (e.g. for large logs)

## Focus

- restore focus e.g. when updating label from asynchronous event
  (focus is lost e.g. when typing into line edit while a custom event arrives that causes
   update of the text of another label)
- concept of yielding focus; decide how to pass focus to siblings/parents

## Autocomplete

- asynchronous

## Separator

- horizontal or vertical
- fixed width, or expand

## Layout

- resize policy: expandX, expandY to consume available space

## Font rendering

- Classes / stream operators for font attributes?

# Testing & Debugging
- Make TerminalWindow an abstract interface to allow mocking and inspection?
- Red flash in rendered areas?

# Misc. issues

- entering special characters problematic: e.g AltGr-o (should render as รถ)
  - received as multi-character input, (1) M-C, (2) M-6
  - Input with EurKey keyboard works on when using getnstr

# Optimization
- paint background only where there is no widget (using click map)?
